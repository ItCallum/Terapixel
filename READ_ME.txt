This is my source code needed for the completion of my project CSC8634_CloudComputingWithProject - The Performance evaluation of Terapixel rendering in Cloud (Super)computing.

THE REPORTS ARE IN \Terapixel_2\reports
Report.pdf is the written report part of my CW, in it I which Is an overview of evertyhing that I did 
Abstract.pdf is my structured abstract

I will discuss what each file in this directory does

- Terapixel_v2.Rproj
	Needed to start the project template 

- Terapixel_2 
	This contianes all the source folders needed to run my project template

- start.r
	If there is any issues in running the project template then this bit of code will be able to help (though you will need to manually set the directory)

- Title_col
	This is the coded needed to run the K means colour Quantization
