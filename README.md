# Terapixel 

This is my source code needed for the completion of my project - The Performance evaluation of Terapixel rendering in Cloud (Super)computing.

A Terapixel image offers a new and intuitive way to present information sets to stakeholders that is also extremely accessible to all, allowing viewers to interactively browse big data across multiple scales. Typically made up of over one trillion pixels and provide a fluid experience where the viewer can see an overview of the whole image or zoom into incredible detail. 

The importance of Terapixel images is that viewing it only depends on the image display capabilities of the web browser that can display it, making terapixel images accessible on a wide range of thin clients. The client would not need any expensive software or hardware to view the image, only a web browser and a link. Terrapixels can also be very detailed allowing for impressive designs that a client might require.

This project will be a performance evaluation looking at processes behind creating the first terapixel visualization of IoT data within a 3D urban environment by Members of Newcastle university.


THE REPORTS ARE IN \Terapixel_2\reports
Report.pdf is the written report part of my CW, in it I which Is an overview of evertyhing that I did 
Abstract.pdf is my structured abstract

I will discuss what each file in this directory does

- Terapixel_v2.Rproj
	Needed to start the project template 

- Terapixel_2 
	This contianes all the source folders needed to run my project template

- start.r
	If there is any issues in running the project template then this bit of code will be able to help (though you will need to manually set the directory)

- Title_col
	This is the coded needed to run the K means colour Quantization
